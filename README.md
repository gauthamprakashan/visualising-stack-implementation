# Visualising the Stack Implementation
This project will help you visualise the implementation of a Stack using array. We will be using various web technologies used in front-end to visualise these concepts in a webpage.

Check ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` for contributing guidelines

### 2. Clone it to your local machine :busts_in_silhouette:

`NOTE: commands are to be executed on Linux, Mac, and Windows(using Powershell)`

```

Create a separate branch for contribution and try to use the same name of the branch as of folder.

To switch to the desired branch

# Schema Design and Mentor Mentee Mapping

## 1. To Create the Mentor Mentee Mapping, we send the unique employee id(uuid v4) from the employees table as a foreign key relation to the mentor_id and mentee_id primary keys of the Mentor table. 
## 2. Each Mentor can have multiple mentees. This mapping is preserved as both the keys together form the primary key and each mentor can have multiple mentees.
## 3. Historical data can also be acceseed without overwriting or violating other constraints. We have start_date and end_date for the duration of the mentorship. The end_date can be set as NULL, for an ongoing mentorship.

# Key Components

## Mentor ID (mentor_id): Unique identifier for mentors, referencing the id field of the employees table.
## Mentee ID (mentee_id): Unique identifier for mentees, also referencing the id field of the employees table.
## Start Date (start_date): Marks the beginning of the mentorship.
## End Date (end_date): Indicates the conclusion of the mentorship (nullable for ongoing relationships).
